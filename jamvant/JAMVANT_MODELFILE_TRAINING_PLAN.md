# JAMVANT ModelFile Training Plan & Concepts

## Understanding Ollama ModelFiles

### What is a ModelFile?
A ModelFile is Ollama's way to create custom models by defining:
- **Base Model**: Starting point (e.g., llama3.2:latest)
- **System Instructions**: Core personality, rules, and behavior
- **Runtime Parameters**: How the model should behave during inference
- **Training Data**: Optional examples and context

### ModelFile Structure
```
FROM llama3.2:latest

SYSTEM """
[System instructions defining personality, rules, context]
"""

PARAMETER temperature 0.1
PARAMETER top_p 0.9
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.1
PARAMETER num_ctx 4096
```

### Training Approach
Unlike fine-tuning, ModelFiles work by:
1. **Prompt Engineering**: Detailed system instructions
2. **Context Injection**: Providing domain-specific knowledge
3. **Parameter Tuning**: Controlling model behavior
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Testing and improving instructions

## JAMVANT Training Strategy

   ```
   
   chmod +x test_phase5.sh
   ./test_phase5.sh

### Step 7: Testing Framework Details
**Each phase test script structure**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Testing JAMVANT Phase X - [Phase Name]"

# Test categories for each phase:
# 1. Regression tests (previous phase capabilities)
# 2. New functionality tests
# 3. Integration tests
# 4. Performance benchmarks

# Example test structure:
echo "=== Regression Tests ==="
# Test previous phase capabilities still work

echo "=== New Functionality Tests ==="
# Test new phase-specific capabilities

echo "=== Integration Tests ==="
# Test how new and old capabilities work together

echo "=== Performance Benchmarks ==="
# Measure response time and quality
```

### Step 8: Version Management Process
**Manual Steps for Each Version**:
1. **Before creating new version**:
   ```bash
   # Document current version performance
   echo "Version X.0 Results:" >> version_history.md
   echo "- Test results: [PASS/FAIL details]" >> version_history.md
   echo "- Performance: [response times]" >> version_history.md
   echo "- Issues found: [list issues]" >> version_history.md
   ```

2. **Create new version**:
   ```bash
   # Build new model
   ollama create jamvant:vX.0 -f jamvant/Modelfile.phaseX
   
   # Test new version
   ./test_phaseX.sh
   
   # Compare with previous version if needed
   ollama run jamvant:v[X-1].0 "same test question"
   ollama run jamvant:vX.0 "same test question"
   ```

3. **Version cleanup decision**:
   - Keep working versions for rollback
   - Document which versions to keep/delete
   - Delete only after confirming new version is stable

        return generateMockLLMResponse(insights, systemContext); // Fallback to mock
    }
}
```

### 🧪 Integration Testing Commands

#### Test JAMVANT Integration:
```bash
# 1. Test JAMVANT is running
ollama list | grep jamvant

# 2. Test direct JAMVANT interaction
ollama run jamvant:v5.0 "Hey! JAMVANT, who are you?"

# 3. Test Ollama API integration
./jamvant/service_integration_test.sh

# 4. Test error analysis
./jamvant/complete_error_training.sh
```

#### Service Integration Training Requirements

**Phase 4 Additional Training - Service Integration**:
Add to Modelfile.phase4 SYSTEM section:
```bash
SERVICE INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
When called via Ollama API from our service, you must:

1. RESPOND ONLY TO "Hey! JAMVANT" PROMPTS
2. PROVIDE VALID JSON IN THE MESSAGE CONTENT
3. NEVER INCLUDE MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS IN JSON RESPONSES
4. ENSURE JSON IS PROPERLY ESCAPED FOR API TRANSMISSION
5. MAINTAIN CONSISTENT RESPONSE STRUCTURE

OLLAMA API RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response will be wrapped in Ollama API format:
- Your content goes in message.content field
- Content must be valid JSON string (escaped)
- No markdown formatting in JSON responses
- No extra text outside the JSON structure

EXAMPLE CORRECT RESPONSE CONTENT:
"{\"analysisId\":\"analysis-001\",\"rootCauseAnalysis\":\"Technical analysis...\",\"businessImpact\":\"HIGH - Impact description...\",\"recommendations\":[{\"action\":\"Specific action\",\"priority\":\"HIGH\"}],\"confidence\":0.92}"

EXAMPLE INCORRECT RESPONSE CONTENT:
```json
{
  "analysisId": "analysis-001",
  "rootCauseAnalysis": "Technical analysis..."
}
```

The service expects pure JSON string, not markdown-formatted JSON blocks.
```
