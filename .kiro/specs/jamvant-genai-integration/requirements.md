# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the trained JAMVANT v5.0 AI model with the existing GenAIAnalysisService to replace mock responses with real AI-powered error analysis and healing recommendations. JAMVANT has been successfully trained through 5 phases and validated for production use. The integration will enable the self-healing system to provide intelligent, context-aware analysis of system errors and actionable healing recommendations through the Ollama API.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the GenAIAnalysisService to use the trained JAMVANT model instead of mock responses, so that I receive real AI-powered analysis of system errors and healing recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GenAIAnalysisService.callRealLLM() method is called THEN the system SHALL call JAMVANT v5.0 via the Ollama API at http://localhost:11434/api/chat
2. WHEN JAMVANT analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL format the prompt with "Hey! JAMVANT, " prefix and append "Provide analysis in JSON format."
3. WHEN the Ollama API call succeeds THEN the system SHALL extract the message content from the Ollama response and return it
4. WHEN the Ollama API call fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and fallback to the existing generateMockLLMResponse() mechanism
5. WHEN self-healing.ai.mock-mode is set to false THEN the system SHALL use real JAMVANT integration instead of mock responses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the JAMVANT integration to be configurable and maintainable, so that I can easily update the model version or API endpoint without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load JAMVANT configuration from application properties
2. WHEN configuration includes ollama.api.url THEN the system SHALL use the specified Ollama API endpoint
3. WHEN configuration includes jamvant.model.version THEN the system SHALL use the specified JAMVANT model version
4. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL use default values (localhost:11434 and jamvant:v5.0)
5. WHEN JAMVANT model version is updated in configuration THEN the system SHALL use the new version without code changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for JAMVANT integration, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor AI analysis performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JAMVANT API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log request details at DEBUG level
2. WHEN JAMVANT API calls succeed THEN the system SHALL log response time and success at INFO level
3. WHEN JAMVANT API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information at ERROR level
4. WHEN fallback to mock responses occurs THEN the system SHALL log the fallback reason at WARN level
5. WHEN JSON parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log parsing errors and attempt graceful degradation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the JAMVANT integration to be thoroughly tested, so that I can verify the AI analysis functionality works correctly in all scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN the system SHALL verify successful JAMVANT API communication
2. WHEN unit tests run THEN the system SHALL test error handling scenarios with mocked Ollama responses
3. WHEN performance tests run THEN the system SHALL verify JAMVANT response times are under 5 seconds
4. WHEN validation tests run THEN the system SHALL verify JAMVANT responses match expected JSON schema
5. WHEN end-to-end tests run THEN the system SHALL verify complete error analysis workflow with real JAMVANT integration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the JAMVANT integration to maintain backward compatibility and system stability, so that existing functionality continues to work while adding AI capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JAMVANT is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating with mock responses
2. WHEN existing API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL return responses in the same format as before
3. WHEN system performance is measured THEN the JAMVANT integration SHALL not increase response times by more than 3 seconds
4. WHEN system resources are monitored THEN the JAMVANT integration SHALL not increase memory usage by more than 100MB
5. WHEN system stability is tested THEN the JAMVANT integration SHALL not introduce new failure points that affect core functionality
